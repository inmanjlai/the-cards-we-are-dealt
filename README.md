# The Cards We're Dealt

## Original Prompt:
I would like to create a 2d game, it will be story based with multiple outcomes based on your choices, with a turn based combat system, (2d as in side scroller), set in a metro 2033 style setting, Act 1 will include starting in the metro and finding people to join your group as you prepare to go to the surface (which is a hostile uninhabitable land, crawling with mutated humans, scavangers, and other dangers), Act 2 will be the surface level, and Act 3 will be going down into the metro even deeper to find the truth (whatever that is). Im not entirely satisfied with the Act 3 so that is changeable. Anyway, I want there to be classes, and equipement. And I want the game to basically be a deckbuilder. Where each piece of equipment gives you certain cards in your deck, and same with you class choice, and you draw from that deck when you get into combat. I havent thought about action economy yet, so maybe I can get some ideas here. I'd like to incorporate cover mechanics, limited resources like ammo/health/food. Food for camping to regen health etc

# Design Overview

## üî• What‚Äôs Already Fun

- **Metro setting + deckbuilder mechanics**: Combining oppressive, atmospheric worldbuilding with the strategic joy of a deckbuilder is a unique hook.
- **Choice-driven story**: Multiple outcomes based on player decisions will boost replayability and immersion.
- **Classes + equipment = deck**: Super smart. Encourages experimentation and adds weight to your gear choices.

## üß† Systems Suggestions

### Combat / Action Economy

To make your turn-based combat snappy and strategic:

- **Standard AP System**: 2‚Äì3 Action Points per turn (e.g., Move = 1, Attack = 1, Reload = 1).
- **Card Costs**: Cards cost different AP depending on power.
  - Light attack = 1 AP
  - Suppressive fire = 2 AP
  - Stimpack = Free but exhausts the card
- **Hand Limit**: Draw 4‚Äì6 cards per turn to keep turns short and decisions tight.

### Cover Mechanics

Lean into the side-scroller format:

- **Cover Zones**: Place waist-high barriers or derelict structures players can move behind.
- **Cover Effects**:
  - Partial cover = 25% damage reduction
  - Full cover = 50% and chance to avoid hits altogether
  - Some enemies could ignore cover or destroy it

### Survival Systems

You‚Äôve already got great ideas here:

- **Ammo as Card Fuel**: Some attack cards require X ammo to be played.
- **Food/Resting**:
  - Campfires/checkpoints = restore health, reshuffle deck, maybe cook for buffs
  - Food scarcity could gate progress or act as soft time pressure.
- **Random Events**: While camping, sometimes ambushes or moral choices pop up (e.g., a starving child asks for food‚Äîdo you help?).

## üß≠ Narrative Progression & Acts

### Act 1 ‚Äì Metro Life

- Focus on recruiting allies and surviving human factions.
- Introduce moral decisions‚Äîare you helping people or just helping yourself?

### Act 2 ‚Äì Surface

- Dangerous traversal, scavenging, and dealing with mutants or rival groups.
- Could add weather hazards (radiation storms, acid rain) that affect your deck/draws.

### Act 3 ‚Äì Deep Metro (Alternative Ideas)

Instead of ‚Äúfinding the truth‚Äù as a vague goal, here are some hooks:

- **The Source**: Something is causing the mutations‚Äîdescend to stop it.
- **Civilization Remnant**: A hidden, thriving community underground‚Äîfriend or foe?
- **Personal Backstory**: The player character has suppressed memories that resurface.

## üé¥ Deckbuilding Ideas

### Classes

- **Soldier**: Weapon-focused, armor-based cards, AoE attacks.
- **Scavenger**: Stealth, evasion, utility cards.
- **Medic**: Buffs, heals, DoTs like poison/stims.
- **Engineer**: Can set traps, create cover, repair gear.

### Card Types

- **Attack**: Requires ammo. High damage but low draw frequency.
- **Tactics**: Positioning, cover use, smoke grenades.
- **Utility**: Medkits, stimulants, scouting.
- **Passive Gear**: Some gear could auto-modify your draw or offer a once-per-combat benefit.

## üß™ Mechanics That Could Really Shine

- **Card Exhaustion/Fatigue**: Some cards are one-use per battle or removed until resting.
- **Party Synergy**: Party members can ‚Äúcombo‚Äù with your moves if placed correctly.
- **Moral Deck Influence**: Player choices influence what types of cards show up (Merciless vs Compassionate, for example).
